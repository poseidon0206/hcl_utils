A frame animater.

The script will take the frames under a directory and animate them using imagemagick commands.

## Requirements

Imagemagick

## Before you start

Please update the **LOGO_FILE** variable.

## Running the script

The script will first crop the images, and shrink them down, then pad your logo on them, before animating them.

You'll end up with animations that has your logo padded.
