# **Back To The Future**

## Great Scott!
The python class allows you to define a year and a month as destination, and the number of years to go back.

The python will first go back to the past and come back to the destined time either by year or by month.

Please see the sample script **great_scott.py** on how it works.

## TO DO
- a method to come back by days.
