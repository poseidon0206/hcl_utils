# Ars√®ne Lupin
The gentleman thief

## Synopsis
Give him a target page, and he'll steal all the
pictures that are linked to the document by the
```<a>``` tags.

Just run the script with the ```-t``` or ```--target```
option followed by the link to the page. The script
will store all the jpgs in the current working
directory.

## TODO
- Take and digest multiple targets.
- Option to specify a destination folder.
