# **Quarter Release**

The class will figure out the current release, as well as the previous and next releases. It will also include some useful strings for the release.

The classes also support monthly releases, in case quarterly releases go out of fashion.

QRelease2 supports any release interval, as long as 12 is divisible by it: so 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 should all work.

Check the sample script **get_rels.py** on how to instantiate them.
